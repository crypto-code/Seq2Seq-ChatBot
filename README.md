Use a Seq2Seq model to Train a ChatBot


## What is Seq2Seq model ?
Seq2seq was first introduced for machine translation, by Google. As the name suggests, seq2seq takes as input a sequence of words(sentence or sentences) and generates an output sequence of words. It does so by use of the recurrent neural network (RNN). Although the vanilla version of RNN is rarely used, its more advanced version i.e. LSTM or GRU are used. This is because RNN suffers from the problem of vanishing gradient(A GRU is used in this example). It develops the context of the word by taking 2 inputs at each point of time. One from the user and other from its previous output, hence the name recurrent (output goes as input).

It mainly has two components i.e encoder and decoder, and hence sometimes it is called the Encoder-Decoder Network.
**Encoder**: It uses deep neural network layers and converts the input words to corresponding hidden vectors. Each vector represents the current word and the context of the word.

**Decoder**: It is similar to the encoder. It takes as input the hidden vector generated by encoder, its own hidden states and current word to produce the next hidden vector and finally predict the next word.
